1. It takes Ryans (0days completed room) to get a list of room codes. (He hasn't done all the rooms, so I could run it against someone else or pull them another way)
2. It requests each rooms leaderboard API to find the points for each. 

# Total points added without first bloods: 130,286 or an average of 152.73 points per room. 
As of todays date: 20/10/2024 - You need:
- 116,804 points to be in the top 50 world
- 100,064 points to be top 150 world
- 73,875 points to be top 500 world
- 65,896 points to be top 700 world
- 58,172 points to be top 1,000 world
---
- Completing all the rooms listed below would make you rank 6 overall. 
- Doing the top 10 point rooms listed will give you 11,906 points or around rank 50,000
- Doing the top 20 point rooms listed will give you 20,020 points or around rank 13,815
- Doing the top 30 point rooms listed will give you 26,640 points or around rank 7,000
- Doing the top 50 point rooms listed will give you 36,506 points or around rank 3,000
- Doing the top 100 point rooms listed will give you 53,592 points or around rank 1,234

>> Also introduced is the ability to grab your completed rooms already and nicely output what needs to be done. Get your USER hash by visiting your profile and monitoring your network tab. You should see a request like this
```https://tryhackme.com/api/v2/public-profile/completed-rooms?user=659d12cf86b9ed139d4d1753&limit=16&page=1```

Take that hash and put it into the script check_your_stats.py like so:
1. ```git clone https://github.com/pentestfunctions/thm-room-points.git```

2. ```cd thm-room-points```

3. ```python check_your_stats.py HASH```

> Replace HASH with your profile HASH.
 This will give you 2 files. completed_rooms.txt and rooms_to_complete.txt with the order of highest points at the top.
